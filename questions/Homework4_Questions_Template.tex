\paragraph{Q4:} \textbf{[4 points]} Given a linear classifier such as SVM which separates two classes (binary decision), how might we use multiple linear classifiers to create a new classifier which separates $k$ classes?

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    Below, we provide pseudocode for a linear classifier. It trains a model on a training set, and then classifies a new test example into one of two classes. Please edit the pseudo-code to convert this into a multi-class classifier. 
\end{tcolorbox}
    
\emph{Hints:} See slides in supervised learning crash course deck, plus your own research. You can take either the one vs.~all (or one vs.~others) approach or the one vs.~one approach in the slides; please declare which approach you take.

\emph{More hints:} Be aware that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The input labels in the multi-class case are different, and you will need to match the expected label input for the \texttt{train\_linear\_classifier} function
    \item You need to make a new decision on how to aggregate or decide on the most confident prediction
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Note:} A more efficient software application would separate the classifier training and testing into two different functions so that the model could be reused without retraining. Feel free to ignore this for now.

\paragraph{Q5:} \textbf{[10 points]} In this homework, we will use a feature descriptor called HOG---`Histogram of Oriented Gradients'. As its name implies, it works similarly to SIFT. In classification, we might extract HOG features across the entire image (not just at interest points).

HOG creates one feature descriptor per image `block'. Each block is split into `cells' covering pixels. HOG outputs a 9-bin histogram of oriented gradients per cell. We append these together to obtain the feature descriptor for each block. As a result, if we have $(z,z)$ cells per block, the feature descriptor for each block will be of size $z \times z \times 9$. In other words, computing HOG over the whole image produces a matrix where each row is a descriptor. 
% On the other hand, a matrix might not useful in some cases. Thus, we might flatten the image as a vector. If we wish to extract a single feature vector per image, we would concatenate all block-level descriptors. (flattening in code --> vector)

\emph{Blocks can overlap as displayed in the diagram below.}

\item \textbf{[6 points]}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
     Given a $72\times72$ image, calculate the number of cells, blocks, and final feature vector size that will occur when we extract HOG features over the whole image with the following parameters using maximum overlap between blocks.

\item \textbf{[4 points]}
When using HOG, the parameters such as pixels per cell and cells per block impact the resulting feature descriptor and so our performance on a classification task.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
    What are the pros and cons of the two parameter combinations? Which might you expect to have better performance? \textbf{[3-6 sentences]}
